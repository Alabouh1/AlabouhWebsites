      Preface
    </strong>
    <br>
    This guide is meant to be used only if you already know the basics of Python, which you can find in <a href="Basics1.html">Beginner in Python</a>.<br>
	Contrary to the previous guide, this guide uses <a href="https://replit.com/languages/python3">Replit</a> as its IDE due to limitations in the machine used to code this site.<br>
    This only alters the visuals of the examples and not the functionality of the code.<br>

	<h2>
	  Code maintainability
	</h2>
	<br>
	Code maintainability refers to making code easier to read and understand and also making unexpected errors easier to fix.
	<br>
	There are 4 main ways to make code more maintainable. Those are:
	<br>
	Comments - You can add a comment in Python by using a '#' before your comment. This can make some more complicated code easier to understand by providing a suitable explanation.<br>
	Modulisation (using modules and functions) - This will be explained later.<br>
	Indentation - Indentation is required in Python so it makes code more maintainable by default. Indents can be added using the TAB key.<br>
	Variable names - Having sensible and suitable variable names can help make code easier to follow through and understand the purpose of.<br>
	
	<h2>
	  Data types
	</h2>
	<br>
	There are 4 key data types that variables can have in Python, with some others existing but being more advanced.
	<br>
	The 4 data types are:
	<br>
	String - A series of characters, also known as text.<br>
	Integer - A numerical value with no decimal values.<br>
	Float - A numerical value that does have or may have decimal values.<br>
	Boolean - A binary value, indicating ON and OFF states only, usually called TRUE and FALSE.<br>
	
	<h2>
	  Loops and iteration
	</h2>
	<br>
	There are two basic types of iterative loops in Python.
	<br>
	While loops are condition-controlled iteration, executing their code as long as a certain condition is met.
	<br>
	For loops are count-controlled interation, execution their code a certain amount of times before stopping.
	<br>

      </a>
    </h3>
    <br>
	':' must be placed after the statements otherwise the interpreter will return a SyntaxError.
	<br>
	
	<h2>
	  Arrays
	</h2>
	<br>
	Arrays can be used to store multiple values in one variable.
	<h3>
	  <a title="Example 3">

	  </a>
	</h3>
	<br>
	To access a specific part of an array you must specify the array and then the position of the value in '[ ]'.<br>
	It is important to note that the first value of an array has the position '0' and not '1'.<br>
	<h3>
	  <a title="Example 4">

	  <a title="Example 5">
		<img src="Assets/IntermExamples/Eg5.png" width="159" height="47">
	  </a>
	</h3>
	<br>
	There are a number of parameters you can run alongside an array. These include:
	<br>
	- append() - Adds an element at the end of the current list.<br>
	- clear() - Removes all the elements in the list.<br>
	- count() - Returns the amount of elements in the current list.<br>
	- insert() - Adds an element at the specified position.<br>
	- pop() - Removes an element from the specified position.<br>
	- remove() - Removes the first element with the specified value.<br>
	
	<h2>
	  Subroutines/Functions
	</h2>
	<br>
	Subroutines, which are also known interchangably as Functions, are pieces of code that are defined near the beginning of a program and are useful when the same piece of code needs to be ran multiple times.<br>
	Using subroutines to make code more maintainable is called modulisation.<br>
	<h3>
	  <a title="Example 6">
		<img src="Assets/IntermExamples/Eg6.png" width="149" height="23">
	  </a>
	</h3>
	<br>
	Subroutines can also be passed variables when they are being executed, use those variables within their code, and then return variables back to the main piece of code.<br>
	<h3>
	  <a title="Example 7">
		<img src="Assets/IntermExamples/Eg7.png" width="312" height="63">
	  </a>
	</h3>
	<br>
	When subroutines are used to make code more readable and maintainable, the process is called 'Modulisation'.
	<br>
	
	<h2>
	  Modules
	</h2>
	<br>
	In complicated programs many subroutines may need to be used.<br>
	To improve code readability, maintainabilty and efficiency, these subroutines can be stored in a seperate file to the code being executed.<br>
	To add these subroutines to the executed program, you must use the 'import' statement followed by the name of the Python file containing the subroutines, called the module.<br>
	After the module is imported, you can run subroutines from it by using its name followed by '.' then the name of the subroutine and the parameters as normal.<br>
	When importing a module, you can also follow the statement with 'as' to change what prefix you need to use to reference the module rather than the original name.<br>
